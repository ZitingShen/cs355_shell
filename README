How to compile: 
make

How to run:
./main

Known bugs and limitaions: 
1. The shell does not support spaces between “%” and numbers, which is consistent with bash's behaviour. We support bg, fg and kill multiple jobs. In kill, if “%” presents before a number, the number is jobid. If no “%” the number is process id. For bg and fg, only job id can be used. Job id can be preceded with or without “%”, just like Linux shell.
2. The shell does not support consecutive ;s or ; at the beginning of a command.
3. Does not support parentheses in cmdline.
4. For piping, all jobs need to be in either foreground or background, specified by one “&” at the end of cmdline.
5. bg, fg, kill, jobs, exit and history cannot be executed in background.

Extra features:
1. tab completion
2. history
3. 
	a. for commands "fg" and "bg", support execution with first argument of command, if only one FG, BG or ST job in the joblist. (e.g. "fg sleep" valid if only one "sleep xx" running/stopped in the joblist).
	b. Also, will print out "bg: sleep: ambiguous job spec" if more than one job starts with the given command string.
4. piping

File Directory:
1. main.cpp: this contains the main loop for our shell
2. joblist.cpp: this file contains our struct joblist, with various methods.
3. evaluate.cpp
